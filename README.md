These two terms are very confusing for developers. Why? Because they look similar. Let's understand these two terms. We will see the actual code.

**Method overloading:** First we will see an example then I will explain it to you. Here is an [example](https://ibb.co/HHyvkqq) .

If you have looked at the example I have shared then you will notice that the two methods have the same name. But they accept different data types . This is called method overloading. If you put a double value then the program will automatically call the method which accepts a double value .

**Method overrding:** Here also we will see an [example](https://ibb.co/37PT1PC) then I will explain it to you. Have a look at the example.

Alright you have seen the example. What is happening here is that we are rewriting the superclass method `makesound().` This is known as method overriding.

So you have learned method overriding and method overloading. Now I have made one question for you to test you. You have to predict the output.

What would be the out of the following [code](https://ibb.co/6YGRB45)?
